ScopeDB is strongly typed, and each value has a specific data type. The data type of a value determines how it can be used in queries and what operations can be performed on it.

## List of data types

| Type      | Description                                |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| int       | 64-bit integer                             |
| uint      | 64-bit unsigned integer                    |
| float     | 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point number [^1] |
| string    | UTF-8 encoded string                       |
| binary    | binary data (byte array)                   |
| interval  | duration stored as 64-bit nanoseconds      |
| timestamp | UNIX epoch stored as 64-bit nanoseconds    |
| boolean   | `true` or `false`                          |
| array     | semi-structured array                      |
| object    | semi-structured key-value pairs            |
| any       | value in any type                          |

For more information about ScopeDB data types, see the following topics:

* [Semi-structured data type](/reference/data-types/semi-structured)
* [Data type conversion](/reference/data-types/conversion)

[^1]: ScopeDB's `float` has a total order. This is in contradiction with the IEEE standard. See [comparison operators](/reference/commands/query-operators/comparison) for more details.
