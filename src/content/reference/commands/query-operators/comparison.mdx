title: Comparison operators
---

Comparison operators are used to test the equality of two input expressions. They are typically used in the `WHERE` clause of a query.

Any value can be compared with another value of the same type. The comparison logics are as follows:

* For boolean values, `true` is greater than `false`.
* For integer and unsigned integer values, the comparison is natural.
* For floating point values, the comparison is natural, with extra caveats:
  * `NaN` is sorted as greater than all other values and equal to itself, in contradiction with the IEEE standard.
  * `+0` is equal to `-0`.
* For string values, the comparison is lexicographical.
* For binary values, the comparison is lexicographical on the byte representation.
* For timestamp value, the comparison is natural.
* For interval values, the comparison is natural.
* For array values, the comparison is lexicographical on an element-wise basis.
* For object values, the comparison is lexicographical on the key-value pairs, sorted by keys.
* For any values, if the types of the two values are same, the comparison follows the rules above. If the types are different, the comparison follows the following type order:
    * Object > Array > Interval > Timestamp > Boolean > String > Binary > Float > Unsigned Int > Int
    * For example, an integer is always less than a string, and a string is always less than an object.
* Any comparison with `NULL` returns `NULL`.

## List of comparison operators

| Operator | Syntax   | Description                          |
|----------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| `=`      | `a = b`  | `a` is equal to `b`.                 |
| `!=`     | `a != b` | `a` is not equal to `b`.             |
| `<>`     | `a <> b` | `a` is not equal to `b`.             |
| `>`      | `a > b`  | `a` is greater than `b`.             |
| `>=`     | `a >= b` | `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. |
| `<`      | `a < b`  | `a` is less than `b`.                |
| `<=`     | `a <= b` | `a` is less than or equal to `b`.    |
